# RDC-conflict
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been plagued by violence for almost 30 years. Civil wars, local disputes and cross-border conflicts have resulted in millions of deaths and the displacement of an estimated 5.6 million people.

Several factors have been identified as contributing to the ongoing conflict in the country’s volatile east. These include ethnic tensions, illegal exploitation of natural resources and a ruling elite that profits from the chaos.

Much of the current violence is concentrated in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces along DRC’s eastern border.
# Visualization rebels of M23 
This visual shows how the M23 rebels movement launched a series of attacks against the FARDC positions in North Kivu province between October 2022 and December 2022, causing many civilian casualties. The M23 rebels were former members of the FARDC who defected over grievances related to their integration and treatment 1. They were also accused of receiving support from Rwanda, which denied any involvement 12. The visual indicates that Kishishi was the most affected location by the violence, with 145 deaths, followed by Rugari and Tongo. Kishishi alone accounted for 46.33% of all deaths across 83 locations. The number of deaths varied from 0 to 145 in different locations, reflecting the intensity and spread of the conflict. With implication of Monusco at  this period 4 civilian died.

## 5 articles that explain what’s gone wrong
### The birth of M23
Since the 1990s, armed groups have been part of the political economy of eastern Congo. Communities created self-defence militias in response to foreign-backed armed groups accused of using war to loot the country’s riches.

Over time, armed mobilisation turned into a goal in itself: to make money, to express political power or simply for the youth to cope with the chaos. Today, more than 120 armed groups are present in eastern DRC.
### Regional Dynamics 
The DRC has accused Rwanda of violating its sovereignty by supporting M23. A United Nations report supported this contention. Kigali, however, has dismissed the findings as “false allegations”.

Tensions between Rwanda and DRC date back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Many of the perpetrators of this violence, which killed about a million Rwandans, fled to the DRC, at the time called Zaire. The post-genocide Rwandan government launched military operations in a bid to force the perpetrators back home to face justice. Rwanda believes the DRC continues to provide refuge for those behind the 1994 massacre.

### The lingerings effects of colonial 
Colonial ways of governing indigenous populations sowed seeds of ethnic tension in present-day Congo. Jacob Cloete’s research set out to establish whether a conflict in North Kivu in 1993 that grabbed headlines was the starting point of the current violence in eastern Congo. He argues, however, that it was the culmination of a much older one rooted in Belgian and German colonialism.

### Questionning the UN's intervention 
Over three decades of war, the Congo has received tens of billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and hosts one of the largest United Nations peacekeeping missions. The mission was established in 1999, and its mandate expanded in 2010 to include the protection of civilians.

The UN mission has long been blamed for failing to stabilise the country despite more than two decades of intervention. But as Delphin Ntanyoma explains, the UN is being blamed for what should be the DRC government’s responsibility: de-escalating violence and finding long-term solutions.

### Rwarding rebelions 
Christopher P. Davey’s research into the Banyamulenge – a sub-group of the Congolese Tutsi ethnic group who originally come from the province of South Kivu in eastern DRC – adds to debate on the factors driving Congo’s violence. He argues that the Banyamulenge’s experiences illustrate how violence in the Congo multiplies across borders, blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator, and is used to win a place in government rather than to overthrow it.
